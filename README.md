# Traverse
Traverse is my attempt at completing what CS1666-RPG was supposed to be. Instead of having to complete the project for school, I could actually work on my own time to implement features I enjoying creating.

I rebuilt the game from the ground up in Gamemaker Studio 2 in order to be able to iterate on features much faster than had I still been working in C++.

At this time, I am still tinkering with the project. Releases will be posted on Github whenever I complete a notable feature.
